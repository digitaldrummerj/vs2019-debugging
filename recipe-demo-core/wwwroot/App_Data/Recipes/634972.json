To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 18 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":432869,"title":"Raymond Reserve Selection Chardonnay","description":"The Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay opens with toasty aromas of vanilla bean, baked pears and a hint of cantaloupe. In the mouth, it offers a medley of harmonious flavors, orange zest, caramel, golden delicious apples, jasmine and lemon.

If you feel like going Greek with your Greek food, assyrtiko and moschofilero are both lovely white wines to pair with chicken, seafood, etc. Agiorgitiko is a full bodied red suitable for roasted meats and lamb. The Boutari Moschofilero with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 14 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435067,"title":"Boutari Moschofilero","description":"Boutari Moschofilero (mo-sko-FEEL-ero) is a premium white wine made from 100% Moschofilero grapes grown in high elevation vineyards in the AOC region of Mantinia in the Peloponnese.For years Boutari Moschofilero has been an important selling white wine in Greece and, until recently, a virtual unknown in the United States. The Boutari winery's vinification of Moschofilero is a breakthrough for Greek wines...and it just might be the start of the next white wine revolution!

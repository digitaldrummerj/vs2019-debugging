for Gingerbread Cookies. Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The La Marca Prosecco with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431976,"title":"La Marca Prosecco","description":"This sparkling wine is a pale, golden straw in color. Bubbles are full textured and persistent. On the nose the wine brings fresh citrus with hints of honey and white flowers. The flavor is fresh and clean, with ripe citrus, lemon, green apple, and touches of grapefruit, minerality, and some toast. The finish is light, refreshing, and crisp.Always serve La Marca Prosecco chilled between 46-50Â°F. A versatile Italian Sparkling wine, La Marca Prosecco can be served in sparkling flutes or white wine glasses. A full bottle serves approximately 5-7 glasses. After pouring the first round, seal the opened bottle with a bottle stopper to keep remaining wine fresh and effervescent and keep the wine chilled to 46-50Â°F. An opened bottle should last about 3-4 hours with the bottle closure.","price":"$19.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/431976-312x231.jpg","averageRating":1.0,"ratingCount":7,"score":0.95454545454545459,"link":"https://www.amazon.com/La-Marca-Prosecco-750-mL/dp/B007Q4Y8VK?tag=spoonacular-20"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li>Sift together flour, baking soda, salt and spices.

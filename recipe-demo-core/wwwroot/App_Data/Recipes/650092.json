Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the salt and melted butter and mix until the butter has thoroughly incorporated; it should be the consistency of wet sand.</li><li>Press and pack the wet graham mixture into six buttered 4 -inch tart pans, making sure it goes up all the way on the sides and that the crust is thick and sturdy.</li><li>Arrange the tarts on 1 or 2 cookie sheets and bake for 12 minutes, or until the crusts are golden, but not browned. Remove the tart shells from the oven and set aside to cool.</li><li>If you are not using spring form pans, carefully remove the crusts from the pans at this stage and follow the recipe as follows.</li><li>The tart crusts can be stored in airtight plastic containers, in a single layer, for up to 24 hours.</li><li>Prepare the lime curd: Put the lime juice, sugar, eggs, and yolks in a stainless steel bowl and whisk well.</li><li>Fill a saucepan halfway with water, and bring the water to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat so the water is simmering. Set the bowl over the pot and whisk the lime mixture occasionally until it thickens, approximately 10 minutes. Then whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time.

Do not over-whip or they will become grainy.</li><li>Transfer the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe it around the edge of each tart. Or, transfer it into a large freezer bag, seal tightly, and snip off one corner.
